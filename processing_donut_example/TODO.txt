Rule 1.2

Rule 4.2

	MAXP is implemented as a hard rule right now, therefore all particles over
	MAXP are destroyed. 

Rule 4.3

	MaxV is a hard rule right now no matter where on the screen one is.

Rule 4.4

	MaxA is a hard rule right now no matter where on the screen one is.

Rule 5.2

	Right now I have it so that MAXA and MAXV are limitations on the magnitude
	vector (XACC,YACC) and (XVEL,YVEL) respectively which makes sense to me
	because otherwise it would mean that you could move twice as fast
	diagonally. However in the OFW example, the limitation is directly on the
	values of XACC and YACC

Rule 5.3

	Might want to aded this to the example, but increases complexity somewhat

Rule 5.5

	Right now the cop does not enforce this

Rule 6.0 

	Not implemented yet
